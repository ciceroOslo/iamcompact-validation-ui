# IAM COMPACT results validation and vetting app

## Introduction

This app is used for performing name-validation and region-mapping on the
modelling results of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) in the IAM COMPACT
project, as well as vetting using the vetting criteria from IPCC AR6, and
comparison with harmonization data (at the moment only population and GDP).
Specification of the vetting criteria for IPCC AR6 vetting rules can be found
in the IPCC AR6 Working Group III report, Annex III, Table 11
([link](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Annex-III.pdf)).

The app is built in Python and Streamlit and will be eventually integrated in
I2AM PARIS, an open-access, data exchange platform for modelling results
([link](https://i2am-paris.eu)).
It is based on a fork from the [I2AM Paris validation app](https://github.com/i2amparis/validation).

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps (ask the developer if you are not
familiar with setting up Python environments):

* Clone the repository to your computer, and cd to it: Go to where you want to
  download the repo, type `git clone https://github.com/ciceroOslo/iamcompact-validation-ui.git`
  then `cd iamcompact-validation-ui`.
* Create a Python virtual environment based on Python 3.11 or 3.12, using any
  any Python environment/package management tool that lets you select a Python
  version (unless your system already has Python 3.11 or 3.12 installed).
* Activate the virtual environment.
* Install the repo using your favorite Python package manager (`pip install .`
  or equivalent in the repo directory). This will install all the required
  dependencies.

You can then run the app as follows:
* In the repo directory, type `streamlit run ui/main.py`
* Go to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

To run the app in a production server, build and run a docker image from
`ui/Dockerfile`. This can also be done locally on your computer if you are
familiar with using Docker and don't want to create a separate Python
environment. The commands are (assuming you want to name your image
`iamcompact_validation_ui`:

* While in the `ui/` directory: `docker build -t iamcompact_validation_ui .`
  (make sure to include the final `.` period!)
* Run the image: `docker run -p 8501:8501 iamcompact_validation_ui`. The `-p`
  option is needed to connect to the required network port.
